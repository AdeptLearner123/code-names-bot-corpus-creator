the better to —
the Big —
the Big Board
the big boys
the Big C
the big enchilada
the big idea
the big lie
the big picture
the big screen
the birds and the bees
the bloom is off the rose
the body beautiful
the bottom falls out
the brass ring
the bread of life
the breath of life
the bright lights
the buck stops with someone 
the call of duty
the calm before the storm
the cat's pajamas
the chattering classes
the cherry on top
the clock is ticking
the coast is clear
the cold light of day
the common good
the common touch
the corridors of power
the course of nature
— the crap out of
the cream of the crop
the cupboard is bare
the cut of someone's jib
thé dansant
the darkest hour is just before the dawn
the dead of night
the dead of winter
the deep end
the devil can quote scripture for his purpose
the devil finds work for idle hands to do
the devil is in the details
the devil looks after his own
the devil to pay
the devil's own —
the die is cast
the dismal science
the dismals
the distaff side
