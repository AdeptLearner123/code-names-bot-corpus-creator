on the barrel
on the barrelhead
on the beam
on the bench
on the bit
on the blink
on the block
on the bludge 
on the books
on the bow
on the bridle
on the broo 
on the bubble
on the bum
on the button
on the cadge
on the campaign trail
on the case
on the cheap
on the chopping block
on the contrary
on the couch
on the credit side
on the daily
on the debit side
on the decrease
on the defensive
on the dole
on the dot
on the double
on the down-low
on the downgrade
on the drawing board
on the edge of one's seat
on the face of it
on the fiddle
on the fly
on the fritz
on the front foot
on the go
on the ground
on the heels of
on the hip
on the hoof
on the hook for
on the hop
on the horizon
on the horn
on the horns of a dilemma
on the hour
