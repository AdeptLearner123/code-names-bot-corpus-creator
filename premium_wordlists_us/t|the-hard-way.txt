the hard way
the heavens open
the high ground
the how and why
the icing on the cake
the ins and outs
the international community
the jewel in the crown
the jig is up
the joke is on someone
the joker in the pack
the jury is still out
the Kaiser's War
the knives are out 
the land of Nod
the land of the free
the last chance saloon
the last gasp
the last straw
the last word
the laugh is on someone
the law of diminishing returns
the law of the jungle
the lay of the land
the length and breadth of
the lesser evil 
the life of Riley
the life of the party
the light of day
the light of one's life
the lights are on, but nobody's home
the likes of
the lion's share
the little woman
â€” the living daylights out of
the living image of
the long and the short of it
the long arm of the law
the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
the Lord's Day
the Lord's Prayer
the Lord's Supper
the love that dare not speak its name
the lowest of the low
the luck of the draw
the luck of the Irish
the mailed fist
the man in the moon
the man on the street
the man upstairs
