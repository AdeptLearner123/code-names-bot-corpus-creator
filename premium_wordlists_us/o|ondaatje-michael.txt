one
-one
one after another
one and all
one and only
one and the same
one another
one by one
one can't win
one cannot live by bread alone
one cannot say
one could be forgiven for doing something
one could care less
one could do something in one's sleep
one could have bitten one's tongue off
one couldn't care less
one day
one fine day
one flesh
one for his nob
one for one
one for the books
one for the road
one good turn deserves another
one hand washes the other
one has made one's bed and must lie in it
one jump ahead
one man's meat is another man's poison
one might as well
one might have known
one moment
one of a kind
one of the boys
one of the girls
one of the lads
one of those days
one of us
one on one
one or the other
one or two
one over the eight
one percent
one should be so lucky
one step ahead
one step at a time
one swallow does not make a summer
one thing after another
one thing and another
