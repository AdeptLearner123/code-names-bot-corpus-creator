in the mix
in the moment
in the mood for something
in the name of

in the nature of things
in the neighborhood of
in the nick of time
in the nuddy 
in the nude

in the second place
in the shape of
in the shit
in the short term
in the soup
in the swim
in the teeth of
in the throes of
in the twinkling of an eye
in the wash
in the way
in the way of
in the whole world
in the wings
in the wink of an eye
in the works
in the world
in the worst way
in the wrong
in the year of our Lord â€”
in their midst
