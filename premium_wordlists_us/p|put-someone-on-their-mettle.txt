put someone on their mettle
put someone or something on the map
put someone or something out of one's mind
put someone or something out of their misery
put someone or something through their paces
put someone or something to flight
put someone or something to the test
put someone out to pasture
put someone right
put someone through the mill
put someone through the wringer
put someone to bed
put someone to death
put someone to shame
put someone to sleep
put someone's ass in a sling
put someone's eyes out
put someone's nose out of joint
put something behind one
put something into effect
put something into operation
put something into perspective
put something into words
put something out to tender
put something to bed
put something to good use
put something to rights
put something to sleep
put stock in
put that in one's pipe and smoke it
put the arm on
put the bite on
put the boot in
put the cart before the horse
put the cat among the pigeons
put the clocks back
put the clocks forward
put the fear of God in someone
put the flags out
put the frighteners on
put the kibosh on
put the make on
put the mockers on
put the mozz on 
put the question
put the screws on
put the skids under
put the squeeze on
put the wind up
put the wood in the hole
