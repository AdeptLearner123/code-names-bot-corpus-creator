it
it depends
It girl
it is all up with
it is high time that â€”
it is only a matter of time
it isn't done
it isn't over till the fat lady sings
it looks like a bomb's hit it
it takes two to tango
it won't do
it'd
it'll
it's
it's a deal
it's a fair cop
it's a free country
it's a long story
it's a small world
it's all Greek to me
it's an ill wind that blows no good
it's no skin off my nose
it's no use crying over spilled milk
it's not on
it's the thought that counts
it's your funeral
