the red planet
the red, white, and blue
the rest is history
the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing
the right stuff
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
the roof of the world
the rough edge of one's tongue
the rub of the green
the salt of the earth
the same old story
the sands of time
the scheme of things
the school of hard knocks
the seven deadly sins
the seven seas
the seven-year itch
the shape of things to come
the shirt off one's back
— the shit out of
the shock of the new
the shoe is on the other foot
the sick man of —
the silent majority
the silent treatment
the silly season
the silver screen
the sky's the limit
the sleep of the just
the slightest —
the small of the back
the small screen
the solid South
the spear side
the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
the spirit world
the sport of kings
the staff of life
the sterner sex
the story goes
the story of one's life
the straight and narrow
the streets are paved with gold
the struggle for existence
the sun is over the yardarm
the Supreme Being
the sword of justice
the tail wags the dog
the thin blue line
the three Rs
