if anything
if ever there was
if I were you
if it ain't broke, don't fix it
if it kills one
if my memory serves me
if need be
if not
if one is a day
if only
if so
if the cap fits, wear it 
if the mountain won't come to Muhammad, Muhammad must go to the mountain
if the shoe fits, wear it
if the worst comes to the worst
if truth be told
if wishes were horses, beggars would ride
if you ask me
if you can't beat them, join them
if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
if you know what I mean
if you like
if you please
if you will
if you'll pardon the expression
