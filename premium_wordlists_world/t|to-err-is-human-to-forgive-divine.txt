to err is human, to forgive divine
to excess
to glory
to go
to God
to hand
to heel
to hell
to hell with
to horse
to kingdom come
to let
to make matters worse
to match
to my mind
to name a few
to no end
to no purpose
to one's credit
to one's disadvantage
to one's dying day
to one's face
to one's feet
to one's fingertips
to one's heart's content
to one's liking
to one's satisfaction
to one's way of thinking
to order
to perfection
to put it mildly
to save one's life
to say nothing of
to say the least 
to scale
to seek
to size
to someone's cost
to someone's knowledge
to spare
â€” to speak of
to start with
to taste
to tell the truth
to that effect
to the bad
to the best of my belief
to the best of one's ability
to the bitter end
to the bone
