have one's finger on the pulse
have one's hands full
have one's hands tied
have one's head screwed on
have one's head up one's arse
have one's head up one's ass
have one's heart in
have one's heart in one's mouth
have one's heart in the right place
have one's moments
have one's nose in a book
have one's snout in the trough

have one's will
have one's wits about one
have one's work cut out
have only oneself to blame
have other irons in the fire

have shot one's bolt
have skin in the game
have someone by the short and curlies 
have someone by the short hairs

have someone in the palm of one's hand
have someone on toast
have someone or something by the balls
have someone or something down as
have someone or something in mind
