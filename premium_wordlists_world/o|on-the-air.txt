on the air
on the back burner
on the back foot
on the ball
on the barrel
on the barrelhead
on the beam
on the bench
on the bit
on the blink
on the block
on the bludge
on the bone
on the bones of one's arse
on the books
on the bounce
on the bow
on the bridle
on the broo
on the bubble
on the bum
on the button
on the cadge
on the campaign trail
on the cards
on the carpet
on the case
on the cheap
on the chopping block
on the contrary
on the couch
on the credit side
on the crest of a wave
on the daily
on the decrease
on the defensive
on the dole
on the door
on the dot
on the down-low
on the downgrade
on the drawing board
on the edge of one's seat
on the face of it
on the fiddle
on the flat
on the fly
on the fritz
on the front foot
on the gad
