a fair suck of the sav
a fate worse than death
a feather in one's cap
a fine kettle of fish
a fine line
a firm hand
a fish out of water
a flea in one's ear
a fly in the ointment
à fond
a fool and his money are soon parted
a foregone conclusion
a fortiori
a free hand
a free ride
a friend at court
a friend in need is a friend indeed
A game
a glutton for punishment
a gogo
a good few
a good job
a good many
a good word
a great deal
a great one for
a grinding halt
a hang of a
a hard act to follow
a head start
a heartbeat away from
a heck of a —
a hell of a —
a helping hand
a high old —
a hill of beans
a home from home
a hornets' nest
a house divided cannot stand
a hundred per cent
a into g
à jour
a kick at the can 
a kick in the pants 
a kick in the teeth
a kind of
a king's ransom
à l'Anglaise
à l'antique
à l'orange
