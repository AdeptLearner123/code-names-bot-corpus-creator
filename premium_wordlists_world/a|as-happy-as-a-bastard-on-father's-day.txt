as happy as a bastard on Father's Day
as happy as a clam
as happy as a pig in shit
as happy as a sandboy
as happy as Larry
as hard as nails
as high as a kite
as I live and breathe
as I see it
as if 
as if there was no tomorrow
as it happens
as it is
as it stands
as it were
as keen as mustard
as large as life
AS level
as likely as not
as long as
as long as one's arm
as luck would have it
as mad as a box of frogs
as mad as a gum tree full of galahs
as mad as a hatter
as mad as a March hare
as mad as a meat axe
as many
as many as
as merry as a grig
as much
as near as
as near as dammit 
as neat as a pin
as nutty as a fruitcake
as of
as of right
as often as not
as old as the hills
as one door closes, another opens
as one man
as opposed to
as per
as per usual
as pissed as a fart
as plain as a pikestaff
as plain as the nose on someone's face
as pleased as Punch
as poor as a church mouse
as pretty as a picture
