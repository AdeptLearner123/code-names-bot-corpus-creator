have been around the block
have been known to do something
have been there before
have bigger fish to fry
have blood on one's hands
have Buckley's chance
have clean hands
have designs on
have egg on one's face
have every confidence in
have everything
have eyes for
have eyes in the back of one's head
have eyes like a hawk
have eyes like saucers
have first dibs on
have gone out with the ark
have got it bad
have had a drop too much
have had a good innings
have had a gutful
have had it
have had it up to here
have had one's chips
have had one's day
have half a mind to do something
have hollow legs
have it
have it away on one's toes
have it both ways
have it coming
have it easy
have it in for
have it in one
have it large
have it made
have it off
have it out
have it your way
have itchy feet
have kangaroos in the top paddock
have kittens
have many irons in the fire
have many strings to one's bow
have mercy on 
have need of something
have nerves of steel
have no business
have no chill
have no concern with
