the last gasp
the last straw
the last word
the laugh is on someone
the law of diminishing returns
the law of the jungle
the length and breadth of
the lesser evil 
the lie of the land
the life and soul of the party 
the life of Riley
the light of day
the light of one's life
the lights are on, but nobody's home
the likes of
the lion's den
the lion's share
the little woman
— the living daylights out of
the living image of
the long and the short of it
the long arm of the law
the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
the Lord's Day
the Lord's Prayer
the Lord's Supper
the love that dare not speak its name
the lowest of the low
the luck of the draw
the luck of the Irish
the mailed fist
the man in black
the man in the moon
the man in white
the man on the Clapham omnibus
the man on the street
the man upstairs
the meat in the sandwich
the middle of nowhere
the mile-high club
the minute that —
the mixture as before
the moment —
the more the merrier
the morning after
the mother of all ——
the music of the spheres
the naked eye
the name of the game
the nature of the beast
