be at something
be at the bottom of
be at the end of
be at the races
be away
be away laughing
be bad news
be barking up the wrong tree
be beaten at the post
be beforehand with
be better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick
be better than nothing
be beyond a joke
be bitten by the — bug
be blown off course
be bored shitless
be born with a silver spoon in one's mouth
be bouncing off the walls
be brought to bed
be built like a brick shithouse
be bumping along the bottom
be burned at the stake
be called to the Bar
be called within the Bar
be cast in a — mould
be caught short
be climbing the walls
be cooking with gas
be cracked up to be
be crook on
be cruel to be kind
be cut out for
— be damned
be done and dusted
be down on
be down to
be downhill all the way
be easier said than done
be economical with the truth
be expecting
be firing blanks
be for it
be for the best
be for the high jump
be fresh out of
be friends with
be frightened of one's shadow
be full bottle on
be full of it
be full of the joys of spring
