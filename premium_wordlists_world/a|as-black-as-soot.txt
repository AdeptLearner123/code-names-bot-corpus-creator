as black as soot
as blind as a bat
as bold as brass
as bright as a button
as brown as a berry
as chance would have it
as cheap as chips
as clean as a whistle
as clear as a bell
as clear as day
as clear as mud
as clever as a wagonload of monkeys
as cold as a witch's tit
as cold as ice
as common as muck
as cool as a cucumber
as cross as two sticks
as daft as a brush
 as dead as a dodo
 as dead as a doornail
as dead as mutton
as deaf as a post
as drunk as a skunk 
 as dry as a bone
as dry as a Pommy's towel
as dry as dust
as dull as dishwater 
as easy as ABC
as easy as falling off a log
as easy as pie
as easy as winking
as far as
as far as — is concerned
as far as I can see
as far as it goes
as far as one can tell
as few as
as fit as a butcher's dog
as fit as a flea
as flat as a pancake
as for
as fresh as a daisy
as full as a goog
as full as a Pommy complaint box
as full as a tick
as game as a pissant
as game as Ned Kelly
as God is my witness
as good as —
as good as gold
