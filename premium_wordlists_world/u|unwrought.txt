up a gum tree
â€” up a storm
up a stump
up a tree
up above
up against
up and about
up and doing
up and down
up and running
up before
up card
up for
up for grabs
up hill and down dale
up in arms
up in the air
up north
up one's alley
up one's game
up one's sleeve
up sticks
up the ante
up the booay
up the duff
up the pole
up the river
up the spout
up the stick
up the wazoo
up there Cazaly!
up to
up to a point
up to date
up to eleven
up to mud
up to no good
up to one's armpits
up to one's ears in
up to one's elbows in
up to one's eyeballs
up to one's neck in
up to one's old tricks
