the fortunes of war
the Forty-five
the four freedoms
the fourth estate
the free world
the fruit of the vine
the fullness of one's heart
the fur will fly
the gaiety of nations
the game is up
the game's not worth the candle
the garden of England
the genuine article
the ghost in the machine
the gift of the gab
the gift of tongues
the girl next door
the glass is half-empty
the glass is half-full
the gloves are off
the Good Book
the Good Shepherd
the gory details
the grass is always greener on the other side
the great and the good
the Great Game
the great unwashed
the green-eyed monster
the groves of Academe
the half of it
the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
the hard way
the heavens open
the heavy mob
â€” the hell out of
the high ground
the how and why
the icing on the cake
the ins and outs
the international community
the jewel in the crown
the jig is up
the joker in the pack
the jury is out
the Kaiser's War
the knives are out 
the Lamb of God 
the land of Nod
the land of the free
the last chance saloon
