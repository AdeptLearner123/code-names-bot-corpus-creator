not half
not have a — bone in one's body
not have a bar of
not have a cat in hell's chance
not have a leg to stand on
not have a penny to bless oneself with
not have a pot to piss in
not have a prayer
not have a shot in one's locker
not have the faintest
not have the foggiest
not have two — to rub together
not in one's right mind
not in the least
not in the same street
not in the slightest
not just any —
not know from nothing
not know if one is coming or going
not know one is born
not know one's arse from one's elbow
not know one's ass from a hole in the ground
not know shit
not know shit from Shinola
not know someone from a bar of soap
not know someone from Adam
not know that
not know the first thing about
not know the meaning of the word
not know what hit one
not know what to do with oneself
not know where to look
not know where to put oneself
not know which way to turn
not least
not let the grass grow under one's feet
not like the look of
not likely!
not long ago
not mince words
not miss a trick
not move a muscle
not much chop
not much fun
not much in it
not nearly
not necessarily
not on your life
not on your nelly
not one's cup of tea
