take the hint
take the King's shilling
take the law into one's own hands
take the liberty
take the lid off 
take the long view
take the Michael
take the mickey
take the mound
take the part of
take the piss out of
take the place of
take the plunge
take the rap
take the rough with the smooth
take the salute
take the shine off
take the stand
take the starch out of
take the trouble
take the veil
take the wind out of someone's sails
take the words out of someone's mouth
take thought
take time by the forelock
take to
take to one's bed
take to one's heels
take to something like a duck to water
take to the bush
take to the road
take turns
take up
take up arms
take up on
take up the baton
take up the cudgels
take up the gauntlet
take up the running
take up with
take wing
take years off
take-all
take-home
take-home pay
take-off board
take-off roll
take-off speed
take-out double
take-with
