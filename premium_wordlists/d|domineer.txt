don't
don't — me
don't ask me!
don't bet on it
don't call us, we'll call you
don't change horses in midstream
don't count your chickens before they're hatched
don't give it another thought
don't hold your breath
don't I know it!
don't mention it
don't put all your eggs in one basket
don't quit your day job
don't spoil the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar
don't start
don't sweat it
don't talk to me about —
don't you believe it!
don't you dare
don't you know
don't-know
