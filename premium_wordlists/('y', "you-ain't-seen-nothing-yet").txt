you ain't seen nothing yet
you and whose army?
you and yours
you bet
you bet your ass
you betcha
you can bet your boots
you can bet your bottom dollar
you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
you can say that again!
you can't have your cake and eat it too
you can't judge a book by its cover
you can't keep a good man down
you can't lose
you can't make bricks without straw
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
you can't win them all
you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
 you could cut something with a knife
you could have fooled me!
you don't say!
you haven't lived!
you know
you know something?
you live and learn
you must be joking
you must be kidding
you name it
you never know
you reap what you sow
you said it!
you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you shouldn't talk
you wait
you wouldn't catch — doing something
you'd
you'll
you're
you're on
you're telling me!
you're welcome
you've
you-all
you-know-what
you-know-who
