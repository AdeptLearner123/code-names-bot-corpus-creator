get one's act together
get one's arms around
get one's arse into gear
get one's blood up
get one's breath back
get one's claws into
get one's dander up
get one's ducks in a row
get one's feet wet
get one's finger out
get one's hand in
get one's hands dirty 
get one's hands on
get one's hooks into
get one's Irish up
get one's jollies
get one's just deserts
get one's knickers in a twist
get one's own back
get one's own way
get one's rocks off
get one's shit together
get one's teeth into
get one's tongue around
get one's wires crossed
get out
get out of
get out of my sight!
get out of someone's face
get out the vote
get over
get over with
get physical
get real!
get religion
get rid of
get shot of
get shut of
get sick
get someone nowhere
get someone wrong
get someone's back up
get someone's goat
get something into one's head
get something off one's chest
get something out of one's system
get something over with
get something straight
get somewhere
get started
