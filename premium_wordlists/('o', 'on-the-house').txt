on the house
on the huh
on the increase
on the jar
on the job
on the lam
on the level
on the line
on the loose
on the make
on the march
on the mark
on the market
on the mat
on the mend
on the minus side
on the money
on the move
on the nail
on the nod
on the nose
on the off chance
on the one hand
on the order of
on the other hand
on the outs
on the outside
on the outside looking in
on the plus side
on the port tack
on the pretext
on the prowl
on the q.t.
on the qui vive
on the quiet
on the rack
on the randan 
on the razor's edge
on the razzle 
on the rebound
on the right side of
on the right track
on the rise
on the road
on the rocks
on the rope
on the ropes
on the run
on the same page
on the scent
