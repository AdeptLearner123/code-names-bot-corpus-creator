the dogs of war
the dust settles
the early hours
the earth moves 
the elephant in the room
the eleventh hour
the Elysian Fields
the emperor's new clothes
the end justifies the means
the end of one's rope
the end of the road
the end of the world
the Established Church
the Eternal City
the evil eye
the Evil One
the exception proves the rule
the eye of a needle
the eye of the storm
the eye of the wind
the face of the earth
the fact of the matter
the fact that
the facts of life
the fair sex
the fat is in the fire
the finer points of
the fog of war
the forbidden degrees
the fortunes of war
the four freedoms
the fourth estate
the free world
the fullness of one's heart
the genuine article
the ghost in the machine
the gift of tongues
the girl next door
the glass is half-empty
the glass is half-full
the gloves are off
the Good Book
the Good Shepherd
the gory details
the grass is always greener on the other side
the great unwashed
the green-eyed monster
the groves of Academe
the half of it
the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
