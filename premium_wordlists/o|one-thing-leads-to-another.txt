one thing leads to another
One Tree Hill
one up
one wasn't born yesterday
one way and another
one's back is turned
one's best bib and tucker
one's best plan
one's best years
one's bounden duty
one's cup runneth over
one's ears are burning
one's eyes are bigger than one's stomach 
one's finer feelings
one's finest hour
one's flesh and blood
one's gorge rises
— one's guts out
one's head is a marley 
— one's head off
one's heart sank into one's boots
one's heart's desire
one's kind
— one's last
one's last breath
one's life's work
one's lips are sealed
one's moment in the sun
one's money's worth
one's nearest and dearest
one's pound of flesh
one's pride and joy
one's salad days
— one's socks off
one's spiritual home
one's strong point

one-dimensional
one-down

one-handed
one-hit wonder
