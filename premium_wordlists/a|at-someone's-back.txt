at someone's back
at someone's beck and call
at someone's command
at someone's elbow
at someone's expense
at someone's feet
at someone's heels
at someone's pleasure
at source
at speed
at stake
at stool
at strain
at table
at that
at that rate
at the best of times
at the bottom of the heap
at the buzzer
at the coalface 
at the door
at the drop of a hat
at the earliest
at the end of the day
at the end of the rainbow
at the expense of
at the furthest
at the hands of
at the instance of
at the latest
at the least 
at the mercy of
at the moment
at the outside
at the ready
at the risk of doing something
at the same time
at the top of one's game
at the top of one's lungs
at the top of the heap
at this rate
at times
at university
at will
at work
at worst
at-
at-bat
at-home
at-risk
