have first dibs on
have gone out with the ark
have got it bad
have had a gutful
have had it
have had one's day
have half a mind to do something
have hollow legs
have it
have it both ways
have it coming
have it easy
have it in for
have it in one
have it made
have it off
have it out
have it your way
have itchy feet
have kittens
have many irons in the fire
have mercy on 
have need of
have nerves of steel
have no business
have no chill
have no concern with
have no filter
have no idea
have no time for
have no truck with
have no use for
have not a â€” bone in one's body
have nothing on
have nothing to lose
have nothing to show for
have on
have one foot in the grave
have one too many
have one's cross to bear
have one's ducks in a row
have one's eye on
have one's feet on the ground
have one's finger on the pulse
have one's hands full
have one's hands tied
have one's head in the clouds
have one's head screwed on
have one's head up one's arse
have one's head up one's ass
