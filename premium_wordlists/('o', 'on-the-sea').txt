on the sea
on the shelf
on the side
on the side of the angels
on the skids
on the sly
on the spectrum
on the spot
on the spur of the moment
on the square
on the starboard tack
on the stocks
on the streets
on the strength of
on the stroke of â€”
on the stump
on the table
on the tiles
on the tip of one's tongue
on the town
on the trot
on the turn
on the up and up
on the upgrade
on the wagon
on the wane
on the warpath
on the way
on the way out
on the whole
on the wing
on the wrong side of
on the wrong track
on thin ice
on tick
on time
on tippy-toes
on tiptoe
on top
on top of
on top of the world
on track
on trial
on velvet
on view
on welfare
on wheels
on which the sun never sets
on your marks
on-air
