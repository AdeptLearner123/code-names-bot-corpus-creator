come into effect
come into line
come into one's kingdom
come into one's own
come into operation
come into question
come into the world
come of
come of age
come off
come off it
come off second best
come on
come on strong
come on to
come one's way

come out in
come out in the wash
come out of the woodwork
come out smelling like a rose

come over
come running
come short
come the old soldier 
come through

come to a head
come to a pretty pass
come to a sticky end
come to an end
come to blows
come to grief
come to grips with
come to life
come to light
come to mind
come to naught
come to no harm
come to nothing
come to one's senses
come to pass
come to rest
come to someone's assistance
come to someone's knowledge
come to terms with
come to that
come to think of it
