be one's own person
be one's own worst enemy
be oneself
be onto a good thing
be onto someone
be onto something
be open to debate
be open with
be out of luck
be out of one's element
be out of the frame
be out of there
be out on one's ear
be out to get someone
be part and parcel of
be party to
be past caring
be poles apart
be pushing up daisies
be putty in someone's hands
be quick off the mark
be quick on the uptake
be reet 
be riding for a fall
be rolling in money
be running on empty
be rushed off one's feet
be saved by the bell
be scared out of one's wits
be scared shitless
be seeing things
be set in concrete
be set in stone
be shot of
be shut of
be sick
be simplicity itself
be sitting pretty
be skin and bones
be slow off the mark
be slow on the uptake
be so bold
be so good as to do something
be someone's doing
be someone's man
be someone's woman
be sorry to say
be spoken for
be staring one in the face
be staring something in the face
