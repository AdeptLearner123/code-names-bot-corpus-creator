there and then
there are plenty more fish in the sea
there but for the grace of God
there goes —
there is little to choose between
there is method in one's madness
there is no harm in ——
there is no help for it
there is no holding someone back
there is no knowing
there is no mistaking someone or something
there is no rose without a thorn
there is no saying
there is no telling
there is nothing to choose between
there is nothing to it
there is something in/to —
there it is
there or thereabouts
there wasn't a dry eye in the house 
there will be hell to pay
there you are
there you go again
there you have it
there's — for you
there's honor among thieves
there's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
there's more than one way to skin a cat
there's more to someone or something than meets the eye
there's no accounting for taste 
there's no fool like an old fool
there's no law against it
there's no love lost between
there's no such thing as a free lunch
there's no time like the present
there's one born every minute
there's safety in numbers
thereby hangs a tale

you ain't seen nothing yet
you and whose army?
you and yours
you bet
you bet your ass
you betcha
you can bet your boots
you can bet your bottom dollar
you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
you can say that again!
you can't have your cake and eat it too
you can't judge a book by its cover
you can't keep a good man down
you can't lose
you can't make bricks without straw
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
you can't win them all
you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
 you could cut something with a knife
you could have fooled me!
you don't say!
you haven't lived!
you know
you know something?
you live and learn
you must be joking
you must be kidding
you name it
you never know
you reap what you sow
you said it!
you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you shouldn't talk
you wait
you wouldn't catch — doing something
you're on
you're telling me!
you're welcome

the penny dropped
the picture of —
the pit of one's stomach
the plot thickens
the point of no return
the poor man's —
the pot calling the kettle black
the powers that be
the printed word
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
the public eye
the R months
the real deal
the real McCoy

the red planet
the red, white, and blue
the rest is history
the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing
the right stuff
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
the roof of the world
the rough edge of one's tongue
the rub of the green
the salt of the earth
the same old story
the sands of time
the scheme of things
the school of hard knocks
the seven deadly sins
the seven seas
the seven-year itch
the shape of things to come
the shirt off one's back
— the shit out of
the shock of the new
the shoe is on the other foot
the sick man of —
the silent majority
the silent treatment
the silly season
the silver screen
the sky's the limit
the sleep of the just
the slightest —
the small of the back
the small screen
the solid South
the spear side
the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
the spirit world
the sport of kings
the staff of life
the sterner sex
the story goes
the story of one's life
the straight and narrow
the streets are paved with gold
the struggle for existence

one way and another
one's back is turned
one's best bib and tucker
one's best plan
one's best years
one's bounden duty
one's cup runneth over
one's ears are burning
one's eyes are bigger than one's stomach 
one's finer feelings
one's finest hour
one's flesh and blood
one's gorge rises
— one's guts out
one's head is a marley 
— one's head off
one's heart sank into one's boots
one's heart's desire
one's kind
— one's last
one's last breath
one's life's work
one's lips are sealed
one's moment in the sun
one's money's worth
one's nearest and dearest
one's pound of flesh
one's pride and joy
one's salad days
— one's socks off
one's spiritual home
one's strong point
