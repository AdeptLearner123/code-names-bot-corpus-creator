a mouth to feed
a mug's game
a multitude of sins
a nail in the coffin of
a name to conjure with
a necessary evil
a needle in a haystack
a new broom sweeps clean
a new lease on life
a new one
a nodding acquaintance
à outrance
a pat on the back
a peg to hang a matter on
a penny for your thoughts
a piece of ass
a piece of cake
a piece of old tackie 
a piece of the action
a piece of the pie
a pig in a poke
a play on words
— a pop
a posteriori
a pox on
a pretty penny
a price on someone's head
a priori
a prophet is not without honor save in his own country
a quick buck
a race against time
a race to the bottom
a rainy day
a rake's progress
a rap on the knuckles
a raw deal
a rebel without a cause
a red rag to a bull
a right one
a road to nowhere
a roll in the hay
a rolling stone gathers no moss
a rough ride
a sack of potatoes
a sandwich short of a picnic
a second thought
a shade —
a short fuse
a shot in the arm
a shot in the dark
