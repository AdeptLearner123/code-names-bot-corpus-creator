not have two — to rub together
not in one's right mind
not in the least
not in the slightest
not just any —
not know from nothing
not know if one is coming or going
not know one's arse from one's elbow
not know one's ass from a hole in the ground
not know shit
not know shit from Shinola
not know someone from Adam
not know that
not know the first thing about
not know the meaning of the word
not know what to do with oneself
not know where to look
not know which way to turn
not least
not let the grass grow under one's feet
not like the look of
not likely!
not long ago
not mince words
not miss a trick
not move a muscle
not much chop
not much fun
not nearly
not necessarily
not on your life
not on your nelly
not one's cup of tea
not one's idea of fun
not one's scene
not pay someone any mind
not playing with a full deck
not put it past someone
not quite
not right in the head
not room to swing a cat
not see further than the end of one's nose
not see someone for dust
not sleep a wink
not so much — as —
not someone's idea of
not stand a ghost of a chance
not suffer fools gladly
not take kindly to
not take no for an answer
