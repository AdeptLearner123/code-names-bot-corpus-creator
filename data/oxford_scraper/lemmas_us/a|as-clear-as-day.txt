as cold as ice
as common as muck
as cool as a cucumber

 as dead as a doornail
as dead as mutton
as deaf as a post
as drunk as a skunk 
 as dry as a bone
as dry as a Pommy's towel
as dry as dust
as dull as dishwater 
as easy as ABC
as easy as falling off a log
as easy as pie
as easy as winking
as far as
as far as — is concerned
as far as I can see
as far as it goes
as far as one can tell
as few as
as fit as a flea
as flat as a pancake
as for
as fresh as a daisy
as full as a goog 
as full as a Pommy complaint box
as game as a pissant
as game as Ned Kelly 
as God is my witness
as good as —
as good as gold
as happy as a clam
as happy as a sandboy 
as hard as nails
as high as a kite
as I live and breathe
as I see it
as if 
as if there was no tomorrow
as it happens
as it is
as it stands
as it were
as large as life
