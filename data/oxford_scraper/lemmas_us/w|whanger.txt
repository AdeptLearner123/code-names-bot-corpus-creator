what about —?
what are you on?
what cheer?
what do you expect?
what do you know?

what do you think this is—bush week? 
what does — know?
what for?
what fun!
what gives?
what goes around comes around
what if —?
what is more
what makes someone tick
what matter?

what with
what you will
what's ado
what's bred in the bone will come out in the flesh
what's good for the goose is good for the gander
what's in a name?
what's new?
what's not to like?
what's the damage?
