a chink in someone's armor
a chip off the old block
a chip on one's shoulder
a clean bill of health
a clean break
a clean sweep
a close thing
a cog in the machine
a conspiracy of silence
a coon's age
a cut above
a deuce of a —
à deux
a devil of a —
a different kettle of fish
a dime a dozen
a dog's age
a dog's life
a done deal
a double-edged sword
a drop in the bucket
a drop too much
a dying breed
a fact of life
a fair deal
a fair shake
a fair suck of the sav 
a fate worse than death
a feather in one's cap
a fine kettle of fish
a firm hand
a fish out of water
a flea in one's ear
a fly in the ointment
a fool and his money are soon parted
a foregone conclusion
a fortiori
a free hand
a free ride
a friend at court
a friend in need is a friend indeed
A game
a glutton for punishment
a gogo
a good few
a good job
a good many
a good word
a great deal
a great one for
