be in at the kill
be in awe of
be in bad odor with
be in flood
be in for
be in good company
be in good odor with
be in like Flynn 
be in luck
be in one's element
be in over one's head
be in pictures
be in someone's black books
be in someone's debt
be in stays
be in the doghouse
be in the frame
be in the know
be in the majority
be in the market for
be in the money
be in the process of doing something
be in the right
be in the same boat
be joined at the hip
be jumping up and down
be just what the doctor ordered
be late to the party
be left at the post
be left for dead
be left holding the bag
be left to oneself
be light on
be light on one's feet
be like a kid in a candy store
be like getting blood from a stone 
be like Piccadilly Circus
be like pulling teeth
be living on borrowed time
be living proof 
be long
be looking over one's shoulders
be lost for words
be lost on
be lost to
be made of money
be made of sterner stuff
be man enough to do
be meat and drink to
be miles away
