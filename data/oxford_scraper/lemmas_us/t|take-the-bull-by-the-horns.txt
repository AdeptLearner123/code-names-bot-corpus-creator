take the bull by the horns
take the cake
take the chair
take the checkered flag
take the chill off
take the count
take the easy way out
take the edge off
take the fall
take the field
take the Fifth
take the Fifth Amendment
take the floor
take the gloves off
take the heat
take the hint
take the initiative
take the law into one's own hands
take the liberty
take the long view
take the measure of
take the Michael
take the mickey
take the mound
take the part of
take the piss out of
take the place of
take the plunge
take the rap
take the rough with the smooth
take the salute
take the shine off
take the stand
take the starch out of someone
take the veil
take the wind out of someone's sails
take the words out of someone's mouth
take thought
take time by the forelock
take to
take to one's bed
take to something like a duck to water
take to the road
take turns
take up
take up arms
take up on
take up residence
take up the baton
take up the cudgels
