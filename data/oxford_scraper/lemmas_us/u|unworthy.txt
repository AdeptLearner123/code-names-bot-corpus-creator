up
â€” up a storm
up a stump
up a tree
up against
up and about
up and down
up and running
up before
up card
up for
up for grabs
up for it
up front
up hill and down dale
up in arms
up in the air
up north
up one's alley
up one's game
up one's sleeve
up sticks
up the ante
up the booay 
up the duff
up the river
up the spout
up the stick
up the wazoo
up to
up to a point
up to date
up to eleven
up to no good
up to one's armpits
up to one's ears in
up to one's elbows in
up to one's eyeballs
