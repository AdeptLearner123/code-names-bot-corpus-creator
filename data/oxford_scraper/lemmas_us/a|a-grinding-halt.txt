a grinding halt
a head start
a heartbeat away from
a heck of a —
a hell of a —
a helping hand
a high old time
a hill of beans
a home away from home
a hornets' nest
a house divided cannot stand
a hundred percent
a into g
a kick in the pants 
a kick in the teeth
a kind of
a king's ransom
à la
à la carte
à la king
à la mode
a la plancha
a laugh a minute
a lead foot
a leap in the dark
a leopard can't change his spots
A level
a level playing field
a lick and a promise
a light touch
a likely story
a little bird told me
a lump in the throat
a man of many parts
a man's man
a match made in heaven
a matter of
a matter of course
a matter of form
a matter of life and death
a matter of opinion
a matter of record
a means to an end
a meeting of minds
a mile a minute
a millstone around someone's neck
a miss is as good as a mile
a monkey on one's back
a month of Sundays
a mote in someone's eye
