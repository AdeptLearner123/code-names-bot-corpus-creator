get one's oats
get one's own back
get one's own way
get one's rocks off
get one's shit together
get one's skates on
get one's teeth into
get one's tongue round
get one's wires crossed
get out
get out of
get out of bed on the wrong side
get out of my sight!
get out of someone's face
get outside of
get over
get over oneself
get over with
get physical
get real!
get religion
get rid of
get rooted
get round
get round to
get shot of
get shut of
get sick
get someone going
get someone nowhere
get someone with child
get someone wrong
get someone's back up
get someone's goat
get something going
get something into one's head
get something off one's chest
get something out of one's system
get something over with
get something straight
get somewhere
get spliced
get started
get stuck in
get stuffed
get the ball rolling
get the best of
get the better of
get the bird
get the bit between one's teeth
