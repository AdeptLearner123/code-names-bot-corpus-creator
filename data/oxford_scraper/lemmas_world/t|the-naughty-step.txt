the naughty step
the new black
the new kid on the block
the new normal
the next world
the night's only a pup
the noble art
the noes have it
the north–south divide
the object of the exercise
the old days
the Old Firm
the oldest profession
the oldest trick in the book
the once
the one
the only game in town
the opiate of the masses
the opium of the people
the opposite sex
the order of the day
the other day
the other side of the coin
the other thing
the other way round
the other week
— the pants off someone
the path of least resistance
the patter of tiny feet
the pen is mightier than the sword
the penny dropped
the picture of —
the pit of one's stomach
the plot thickens
the point of no return
the poor man's —
the pot calling the kettle black
the powers that be
the printed word
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
the public eye
the R months
the real deal
the real McCoy
the real thing
the reality is —
the red planet
the rest is history
the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing
the right stuff
