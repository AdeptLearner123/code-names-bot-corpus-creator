be late to the party
be left at the post
be left for dead
be left holding the baby
be left to oneself
be level pegging
be light on
be light on one's feet
be like a kid in a candy store
be like a kid in a sweet shop
be like getting blood from a stone 
be like Piccadilly Circus
be like pulling teeth
be living on borrowed time
be living proof 
be long
be looking over one's shoulders
be lost for words
be lost on
be made of money
be made of sterner stuff
be made up
be man enough to do
be meat and drink to
be mentioned in dispatches
be miles away
be mixed up in
be mixed up with
be more than just a pretty face
be much good
be my guest
be no bad thing
be no fool
be no friend of 
be no good
be no good to gundy
be no joke
be no oil painting
be no picnic
be no respecter of persons
be no use
be none of one's business
be none the wiser
be not about to do something
be not getting any younger
be not having any 
be not long for this world
be not to know
be not worth a cracker
be not worth a crumpet
