a tempest in a teapot
a tempo
a thick skin
a thin skin
a thing of the past
a thing or two
a thorn in someone's side
a tight spot
A to Z
a touch
a tough nut to crack
a tough row to hoe
— a treat
a trifle
a trouble shared is a trouble halved
a turn of the screw
a twinkle in someone's eye
a voice in the wilderness
a walk in the park
a watched pot never boils
a week on —
a whale of a —
a whole ’nother
a wigwam for a goose's bridle
a wolf in sheep's clothing
a woman's woman
a word to the wise
a world away from
a world of
a year and a day
