the better part of
the better to —
the betting is
the Big —
the Big Board
the big boys
the Big C
the big enchilada
the big idea
the big lie
the big picture
the big screen
the big stick
the bird has flown
the birds and the bees
the biter bitten
the bloom is off the rose
the body beautiful
the boot is on the other foot
the bottom falls out
the brass ring
the bread of life
the breath of life
the buck stops with someone 
the call of duty
the call of nature
the calm before the storm
the cat's whiskers
the chattering classes
the cherry on the cake
the clock is ticking
the coast is clear
the common good
the common touch
the common weal
thé complet
the corridors of power
the course of nature
— the crap out of
the cream of the crop
the cut of someone's jib
the damage is done
thé dansant
the darkest hour is just before the dawn
the dead heart
the dead of night
the dead of winter
the dead ring of
the debit side
the deep end
