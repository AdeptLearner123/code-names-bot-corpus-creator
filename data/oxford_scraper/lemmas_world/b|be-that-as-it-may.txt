be that as it may
be the best of friends
be the case
be the death of
be the despair of
be the end
be the limit
be the making of someone
be the marrying kind
be the most
be the pits
be the shit
be the shizzle
be the spit of
be there for
be thick on the ground
be thin on the ground
be tickets
be tickled pink
be to blame
be to do with
be toast
be twice the man that someone is
be unable to believe one's ears
be unable to believe one's eyes
be unable to believe one's luck
be unable to believe something
be unable to hear oneself think
be unable to punch one's way out of a paper bag
be unable to see the wood for the trees
be under no illusion 
be under the illusion that
be up shit creek
be up the creek
be up with the lark
be well away
be well in with
be well out of
be well rid of
be well up on
be wise after the event
be with someone
be woman enough to do
be worth one's weight in gold
be wreathed in smiles
be written all over one's face
