you couldn't make it up
you don't say!
you have no idea
you haven't lived!
you know
you know something?
you live and learn
you might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb
you must be joking
you must be kidding

you said it!

you wouldn't catch â€” doing something
you wouldn't read about it
you'd
you'll
you're
you're a star!
you're on
you're telling me
you're welcome
you've
you-all
you-all's
you-alls
you-know-what
you-know-who
you-uns
