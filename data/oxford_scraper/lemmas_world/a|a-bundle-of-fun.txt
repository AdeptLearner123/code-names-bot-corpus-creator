a bundle of fun
a bundle of joy
a burr under someone's saddle
a busman's holiday
a call to arms
a can of worms
a cappella
a card up one's sleeve
a cat may look at a king
a change is as good as a rest
a change of air
a change of heart
a chapter of accidents
a chara
a chink in someone's armour
a chip off the old block
a chip on one's shoulder
a class apart
a clean bill of health
a clean break
a clean sweep
a close thing
a cock-horse
a cog in the machine
a conspiracy of silence
à contre-coeur
a coon's age
a counsel of despair
a counsel of perfection
a cow of a —
a cricket score
a cut above
a deal of
a deuce of a —
à deux
a devil of a —
a different kettle of fish
a dime a dozen
a dog's age
a dog's breakfast 
a dog's life
a done deal
a double-edged sword
a drop in the ocean
a dusty answer
a dying breed
a fact of life
a fair cow
a fair deal
a fair shake
