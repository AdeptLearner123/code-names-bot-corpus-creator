not at all
not at home
not bad
not bat an eye
not be able to do something a lick
not be able to do something for toffee
not be above
not be an option
not be fussy
not be oneself
not be someone's day
not be someone's first rodeo
not be worth a damn
not bear thinking about
not before time
not best pleased
not blink an eye
not breathe a word
not but what
not by a long chalk
not by a long shot
not care a hoot
not care two straws
not cricket
not do a hand's turn
not do a stroke of work
not do something for the world
not do things by halves
not exactly
not for a minute
not for a moment
not for all the tea in China
not for lack of trying
not for love or money
not for nothing
not forgetting â€”
not give a bugger
not give a damn
not give a fig
not give a hang
not give a monkey's
not give a rat's ass
not give a shit
not give a stuff
not give a tinker's cuss
not give a whoop
not give give a hoot
not give something houseroom
not go any further
not guilty
