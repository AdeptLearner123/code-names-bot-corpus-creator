it
It boy
it depends
It girl
it is all up with
it is high time that —
it is only a matter of time
it isn't done
it isn't over till the fat lady sings
it makes no odds
it never rains but it pours
it takes all sorts to make a world
it takes two to tango
it won't do
it'd
it'll
it'll be all right on the night
it's
it's a case of —
it's a deal
it's a fair cop
it's a free country
it's a long lane that has no turning
it's a long story
it's a small world
it's all Greek to me
it's all right for —
it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good
it's early days
it's no skin off my nose
it's no use crying over spilled milk
it's not on
it's the thought that counts
it's your funeral
