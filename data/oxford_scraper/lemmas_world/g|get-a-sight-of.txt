get a sight of
get a thick ear
get a wiggle on
get a word in edgeways
get a word in edgewise
get across
get ahead
get ahead of oneself
get along
get at
get away
get away with
get away with murder
get back at
get back into the swing of things
get back to
get back to nature
get beyond a joke
get busy
get by
get cracking
get down
get down to
get down to brass tacks
get down to business
get even
get going
get hell
get hitched
get hold of
get ideas
get in
get in on
get in on the act
get in on the ground floor
get in there
get in with
get into
get into the swing of things
get it in one
get it in the neck
get it on
get it up
get itchy feet
get knotted
get laid
get lost
get lost in the shuffle
get lucky
get mixed up in
