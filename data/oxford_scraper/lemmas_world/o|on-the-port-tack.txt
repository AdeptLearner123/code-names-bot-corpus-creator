on the port tack
on the pretext
on the prod
on the prowl
on the q.t.
on the qui vive
on the quiet
on the rack
on the rails
on the randan
on the razzle
on the rebound
on the right side of
on the right track
on the rise
on the road
on the rocks
on the rope
on the ropes
on the run
on the same page
on the scent
on the score of
on the scrounge
on the sea
on the shelf
on the shicker
on the sick
on the side
on the side of the angels
on the skew
on the skids
on the slide
on the slops
on the sly
on the spectrum
on the spot
on the spur of the moment
on the square
on the starboard tack
on the stocks
on the streets
on the strength of
on the stroke of â€”
on the table
on the telephone
on the tiles
on the tip of one's tongue
on the town
on the trot
