one wasn't born yesterday
one way and another
one will be lucky 
one's all
one's back is turned
one's best bib and tucker
one's best plan
one's best years
one's better feelings
one's blood is up
one's bounden duty
one's cup runneth over
one's daily bread
one's ears are burning
one's ears prick up
one's eyes are bigger than one's stomach 
one's finer feelings
one's finest hour
one's flesh and blood
one's gorge rises
— one's guts out
one's head is a marley
— one's head off
one's head swells
one's heart goes out to
one's heart sinks
one's heart's desire
one's humble abode
one's jaw drops
one's kind
— one's last
one's last breath
one's life's work
one's line of country
one's lips are sealed
one's luck is in
one's mark
one's moment in the sun
one's money's worth
one's nearest and dearest
one's pound of flesh
one's pride and joy
one's salad days
— one's socks off
one's spiritual home
one's strong point
one-act
one-acter
one-argument
one-arm
