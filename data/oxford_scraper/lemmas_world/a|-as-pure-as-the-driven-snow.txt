 as pure as the driven snow
as quiet as a mouse
as rare as hen's teeth
as regards
as regular as clockwork
as rich as Croesus
 as right as a trivet
as right as rain
as rough as guts
as safe as houses
as sick as a dog
as sick as a parrot
as silent as the grave
as silly as a two-bob watch
as slim as a reed
 as slippery as an eel
as smart as a whip
as snug as a bug in a rug 
as sober as a judge
 as straight as a die
as straight as an arrow
as strong as an ox
as stubborn as a mule
as such
As Sulaymaniyah
as sure as death
as sure as eggs is eggs
as sweet as pie
as the case may be
as the crow flies
as the fancy takes one
as the saying goes
as thick as a brick
as thick as poundies
as thick as thieves
as thick as two short planks
as thin as a rake
as tight as a tick
as to
as tough as nails
as warm as toast
as was
— as we know it
as well
as well —— might 
as well as
as white as a sheet
as who should say
as yet
as you do
