not one's idea of fun
not one's scene
not out
not pay someone any mind
not playing with a full deck
not proven
not put it past someone
not quite
not quite the thing
not right in the head
not room to swing a cat
not see further than the end of one's nose
not see someone for dust
not sleep a wink
not so dusty
not so much — as —
not someone's idea of
not stand an earthly
not stand the ghost of a chance
not suffer fools gladly
not take kindly to
not take no for an answer
not that
not the full quid
not the full shilling
not the only pebble on the beach
not the sharpest knife in the drawer
not to be
not to be sneezed at
not to be sniffed at
not to mention
not to put too fine a point on it
not to say
not to speak of
not to worry
not touch with a bargepole
not touch with a ten-foot pole
not trust someone as far as one can throw them
not turn a hair
not very
not want to know
not worth a shit
not-being
not-for-profit
not-go
not-I
not-life
not-living
not-me
not-ness
