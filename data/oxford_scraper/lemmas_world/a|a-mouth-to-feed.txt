a mouth to feed
a mug's game
a multitude of sins
a nail in the coffin of
a name to conjure with
a nasty one
a nasty piece of work
a necessary evil
a needle in a haystack
a new broom sweeps clean
a new lease of life
a new one
a nice little earner
a nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse
a notch on someone's bedpost
à outrance
a pat on the back
a peg to hang something on
a penny for your thoughts
a piece of ass
a piece of cake
a piece of old tackie
a piece of piss
a piece of the action
a piece of the pie
a pig in a poke
a pig of a —
a place in the sun
a play on words
— a pop
a posteriori
a pound to a penny
a pox on
a pretty penny
a price on someone's head
a priori
a prophet is not without honour save in his own country
a quick buck
a quick one
a race against time
a race to the bottom
a rainy day
a rake's progress
a rap on the knuckles
a raw deal
a real live —
a rebel without a cause
a red rag to a bull
a right one
a road to nowhere
