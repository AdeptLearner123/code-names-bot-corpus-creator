be ghost
be gone on
be good news
be good to go
be grateful for small mercies
be hanging over someone's head
be hard on
be hard put
be hearing things
be hell on
be hell on wheels
be here to stay
be history
be hoist by one's own petard
be in a cleft stick
be in a minority of one
be in at the death
be in at the kill
be in awe of
be in bad odour with
be in credit
be in debit
be in flood
be in for
be in good company
be in good odour with
be in like Flynn
be in luck
be in one's element
be in over one's head
be in pictures
be in someone's black books
be in someone's debt
be in something for the long haul
be in stays
be in the doghouse
be in the frame
be in the know
be in the majority
be in the market for
be in the money
be in the process of doing something
be in the right
be in the same boat
be in the wars
be in two minds
be in with a chance
be joined at the hip
be jumping up and down
be just what the doctor ordered
