a Roland for an Oliver
a roll in the hay
a rolling stone gathers no moss
a rope of sand
a rough ride
a rum go
a rush of blood to the head
a sack of potatoes
a safe pair of hands
a sandwich short of a picnic
a second thought
a shade —
a shingle short
a short fuse
a shot in the arm
a shot in the dark
a shoulder to cry on
a sight —
a sight for sore eyes
a sight to behold
a sinking feeling
a sinking ship
a slap in the face
a slap on the back
a slap on the wrist
a slice of life
a slip of a —
a smack in the face 
a small fortune
a snowball's chance in hell 
a song and dance
a spanner in the works
a spare prick at a wedding
a sprat to catch a mackerel
a square peg in a round hole
a stab in the back
a sticky wicket
a stiff upper lip
a stitch in time saves nine
a stone's throw
a storm in a teacup
a straight face
a straight fight
a straw in the wind
a strong stomach
a stubby short of a sixpack
a tale of a tub
a tall order
a tall tale
a tangled web
