there
there and then
there are plenty more fish in the sea
there but for the grace of God
there goes —
there is little to choose between
there is method in one's madness
there is no harm in ——
there is no help for it
there is no holding someone back
there is no knowing
there is no mistaking someone or something
there is no rose without a thorn
there is no saying
there is no telling
there is nothing to choose between
there is nothing to it
there is something in/to —
there it is
there or thereabouts
there wasn't a dry eye in the house 
there will be hell to pay
there you are
there you go again
there you have it
there's
there's — for you
there's honor among thieves
there's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
there's more than one way to skin a cat
there's more to someone or something than meets the eye
there's no accounting for taste 
there's no fool like an old fool
there's no law against it
there's no love lost between
there's no such thing as a free lunch
there's no time like the present
there's one born every minute
there's safety in numbers

you bet
you bet your ass

you can bet your boots
you can bet your bottom dollar
you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
you can say that again!
you can't have your cake and eat it too
you can't judge a book by its cover
you can't keep a good man down
you can't lose
you can't make bricks without straw
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
you can't win them all
you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
 you could cut something with a knife
you could have fooled me!
you don't say!
you haven't lived!
you know
you know something?
you live and learn
you must be joking
you must be kidding
you name it
you never know
you reap what you sow
you said it!
you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you shouldn't talk

It girl
it is all up with
it is high time that —
it is only a matter of time
it isn't done
it isn't over till the fat lady sings
it looks like a bomb's hit it
it takes two to tango
it won't do
it'd
it'll
it's
it's a deal
it's a fair cop
it's a free country
it's a long story
it's a small world
it's all Greek to me
it's an ill wind that blows no good
it's no skin off my nose
it's no use crying over spilled milk
it's not on
it's the thought that counts
it's your funeral

the middle of nowhere
the minute that —
the moment —
the more the merrier
the morning after
the mother of all ——
the music of the spheres
the naked eye
the name of the game
the nature of the beast
the new black
the new kid on the block
the new normal
the next world
the noes have it
the old days
the old sod
the oldest profession
the oldest trick in the book
the once
the one
the only game in town
the opiate of the masses
the opium of the people
the opposite sex
the order of the day
the other day
the other side of the coin
the other way around
the other week
— the pants off someone
the path of least resistance
the patter of tiny feet
the pen is mightier than the sword
the penny dropped
the picture of —
the pit of one's stomach
the plot thickens
the point of no return
the poor man's —
the pot calling the kettle black
the powers that be
the printed word
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
the public eye
the R months
the real deal
the real McCoy
the real thing
the reality is —

one's bounden duty
one's cup runneth over
one's ears are burning
one's eyes are bigger than one's stomach 
one's finer feelings
one's finest hour
one's flesh and blood
one's gorge rises
— one's guts out
one's head is a marley 
— one's head off
one's heart sank into one's boots
one's heart's desire
one's kind
— one's last
one's last breath
one's life's work
one's lips are sealed
one's moment in the sun
one's money's worth
one's nearest and dearest
one's pound of flesh
one's pride and joy
one's salad days

one's spiritual home
one's strong point

if so
if the shoe fits, wear it
if truth be told
if wishes were horses, beggars would ride
if worst comes to worst
if you ask me
if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
if you know what I mean
if you like
if you please
if you will
if you've got it, flaunt it
